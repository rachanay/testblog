								<h1>Hi  I'm <strong>Rachana.Y</strong>.</h1>

							<p>And this is my blog. Having worked as both a <strong>Business Data & Insights</strong> Analyst for <strong>CitiBank</strong> and a <strong>Marketing Mix Optimization</strong> Analyst for <strong>Pernod Ricard</strong>, I now understand both data and marketing perspectives. I aim to <strong>bridge the gap</strong> between <strong>data and marketing</strong>. </p>

						<h1><strong>1.The Aperitif Battle</strong>.</h1>
						<p>This was my first international multi-market project with the aperitif brand Lillet, and I was very excited. Lillet was launching a new packaging design in four key markets, and a market research study was conducted in all four to understand the performance of the new design compared to key competitors. I wanted to understand the brand better before attending the briefing session.</p>
					</header>

						<h2><strong>What is an aperitif?</strong></h2>
						<p>I started from the beginning. I surfed a bit to understand what an apéritif is. An apéritif is an alcoholic beverage typically served before a meal to stimulate the appetite. The word apéritif comes from the Latin word aperire, meaning to open, which reflects its purpose of preparing the palate and stomach for food.</p>
					</header>
					<header>
						<p>Now that I understood what an apéritif was, I wanted to learn more about the brands in this category and how they were perceived from a consumer’s point of view. I was also interested in identifying the leading markets and understanding how Lillet was performing compared to its competitors from a consumer perspective.</p>

								<h3>The Idea</h3>
								<p>While considering more reliable methods to authentically understand the brand, I suddenly remembered my marketing research professor mentioning that user-generated content (UGC) is the new oil.</p>

							<section class="box style1">
								<span class="icon solid featured fa-camera-retro"></span>
								<h3>Plan</h3>
								<p>My initial plan was to scrape all Lillet reviews on Amazon. However, since the project included competitor studies, I focused on the most recent three years of reviews for Lillet and its competitors.  </p>

								<span class="icon featured fa-thumbs-up"></span>
								<h3>Tools</h3>
								<p>Webscraping: I wrote a Python code using  BeautifulSoup and Pandas.Data - Cleaning: I used  Excel formulas to clean the data.
								Data - Visualisation: Power BI  to build dashboards</p>

						<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
						<p>After my initial analysis, I understood that all three brands have relatively good ratings. The slight drop in Lillet ratings was not due to the product itself but rather because of damages occurring during deliveries. Different brands have different leading markets. As Campari and Aperol are Italian brands, Italy was the lead market for both. However, for Campari the other key market was Germany, while for Aperol the other key market was the UK, where it is well known as Spritz.</p>
						<p>For Lillet, being a French brand, France is one of its key markets, but Germany leads in terms of the number of reviews for Lillet. This insight was quite helpful as the Lillet team treats Germany as the lead market. Regarding seasonality, France saw more Lillet reviews during the holiday season of November, December, and January.</p>

						<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
						<p>Although the insights I gathered were not directly related to the pack restage itself, I was able to understand the brand better & help the team study the market research results more effectively in each market according to their needs. Therefore, I would say this initial personal work provided me with valuable insights before diving into the project.</p>
